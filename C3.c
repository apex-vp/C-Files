/*
  🔴C is :-
    • High level
    • Compiled = C is Compiled language eg. if u write 1000 lines of code in C 
                📝then compiler converts all code in One Time (Not Compile line by line)
                📝in JavaScript we have Interpreter so it converts line by line in JS
    • Procedural = means we used multiple functions and we call them one by one by need
    • Blocked-Structured (Control Structure) = if-else, nestedif else ...etc. 
    • Typed = Data types int, float, ch, ....etc.
    • Library Function = printf, scanf, mallac, alloc, etc 
 
  🔴Strengths:-
    •Low level memory aceess(Pointers, data Structures)
    •Effective memory access (Bitwise Operators, bit-fields, unions)
    •Can access OS features (Function/Commands)
    •Extensive Library Functions (math, strings, file I/O..) (string length, string reverse, string compare, fgetc, fputc, fopen, fclose)
    •Compilers for Different platforms and Architectures
    •Highly readable(macros, enum, functions,...)
