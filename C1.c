    1. Compilation:
        gcc C1.c --> [ a.exe file generated (when compilation is succussful then a. exe file generated)]
        
        a) If compilation is successful a.exe file is created.
    
    2. Execution:
        b) Is succefully compiled then you can execute your code. 

    Eg. Car Start => Compilation
        Car Drive => Execution
        
        Car NOT Starting => Compilation Error
        Car NOT Driving => Execution Error
